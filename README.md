This is a starting point for Go solutions to the
["Build Your Own HTTP server" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/overview).

[HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) is the
protocol that powers the web. In this challenge, you'll build a HTTP/1.1 server
that is capable of serving multiple clients.

Along the way you'll learn about TCP servers,
[HTTP request syntax](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec5.html),
and more.

**Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to
[codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) to try the challenge.

# Passing the first stage

<<<<<<< HEAD
The entry point for your HTTP server implementation is in `app/main.go`. Study
and uncomment the relevant code, and push your changes to pass the first stage:

```sh
git commit -am "pass 1st stage" # any msg
